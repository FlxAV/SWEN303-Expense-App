# Design Review

## Introduction
In this section, we conducted a comprehensive review of the proposed designs using an expert evaluation technique. The purpose of this review was to identify potential usability issues, assess the strengths and weaknesses of each design, and gather insights to inform the development of our final prototype.

## Evaluation Method
We chose to employ a heuristic evaluation method based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. Each team member independently reviewed the designs and provided their findings. The heuristics we focused on include:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation
