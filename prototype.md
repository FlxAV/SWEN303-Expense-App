After clicking "Done" you would be taken back to the group tab as well, however this time the group you created will appear at the top. You will see the icon/image you selected for that group, as well as the avatar of the first three people in that group. If there are none, none would be shown, if one then one and so on... The words" No expenses" will be seen as well since there have been no expenses added to that group, and finally on the right is a right pointing arrow to invite the user to click on the group.

The description you wrote, the list of memebers with a big plus to signal where to click o add a member to this group, and finally an area for where the expenses created for this group will be displayed (none at the moment).

When clicking on the "add expense" text or the Add button on the bottom on the hot bar, you get taken to the "Add expense" tab. This tab starts off with a search bar with a filter that allows you to look up a specific group that you want to add the expense to. Beneath is a horizontally scrollable tab with widgets of each group you have. By default the group you are in when clicking add expense will be selected but you can choose specifically which group you would like by simply clicking on the group when scrolling.
Beneath is the information about the expense including: A description, the amount, and the date of the expense. You can change the type of expense by clicking on the icon next to "Descripton" and you can change the type of currency by clicking on the icon next to the "amount". After that is the splitting function, which starts off with three buttons that allow you to switch between ways of splitting the expense including: Manually, Percentage and Equally. Underneath is then listed all the memebers of the group you previously selected showing the amount you assigned to each. If you would like to modify the shares you can click on the amount and a keyboard will pop to allow you to enter the desired amount. At the bottom is the "save expense" button.

This is the same as before except that now the group tab doesn't say "No expenses" but instead specifies the net amount that you are owed or that you owe accross all the expenses in the group, allowing you to see if you are up or down money in that group. Another thing is the widget expends to include a drop down that will list the top three people that either owe you or that you owe to. This is limited to three and then "..." to avoid being too large. We will now take a look at he "Friends" tab which we access by either clicking the button at the top right or by simply swiping right on your screen.
