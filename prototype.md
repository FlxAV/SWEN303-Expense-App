After clicking on the purple "+Create new group" button you are taken to a tab to create said group. At the top would be the default icon for a group with a plus which allows you to modify this image to your liking. There is a space to insert a name for the group, a space for a description, and a search bar. This search bar is look up the name of a friend that is in your friends list, there is a filter icon which allows you to narrow down your searching.
Beneath it is the members you have currently added to your group with a button that allows you to remove them if unwanted from the group. Beneath that again is a list of all your friends in alphabetical order which you can scroll through. In the top left is "Back" with an arrow, this would just take you back to the groups tab. At the top right is "Done" which you click once you have completed all the steps required for creating a group ("Done" is in the prototype however this image is missing it).

After clicking "Done" you would be taken back to the group tab as well, however this time the group you created will appear at the top. You will see the icon/image you selected for that group, as well as the avatar of the first three people in that group. If there are none, none would be shown, if one then one and so on... The words" No expenses" will be seen as well since there have been no expenses added to that group, and finally on the right is a right pointing arrow to invite the user to click on the group.
