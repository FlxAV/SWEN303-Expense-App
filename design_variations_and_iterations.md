# Revisions and Iterations

## Introduction
In this section, we present the iterative design process that led to our final prototype. Building upon the initial wireframes and user flows from Assignment 2, we collaborated as a group to refine and improve the designs based on the insights gained from the design review and our collective design vision. Using the UI/UX design rules to help guide us to ensure the app is easy and functional to use.

### Navigation
- **Design Choices:** We decided between a five tab or three tab layout for our navigation. We decided on using the five tab layout as it was more effective for the user to navigate using.
