# Background

In a world where shared living and group activities are increasingly common, managing shared expenses efficiently can be a significant challenge. This is particularly true for flatmates sharing household bills, friend groups dining out together, or travelers on a group trip. Miscommunication, forgotten payments, and complex calculations can lead to frustration and even strain relationships. Our app addresses these issues by providing a simple and effective solution to split bills and expenses among group members.

Our application is designed for users who live with flatmates, allowing them to easily add and split recurring household expenses such as rent, electricity, water, and Wi-Fi. Additionally, it caters to various social scenarios like dining out with friends, where one person pays the bill and others reimburse them later. It also supports group activities and trips, enabling users to create groups, add expenses, and specify who owes what.

This app stands out by offering:
- User-Friendly Interface: The app ensures that adding expenses and splitting bills is intuitive and quick, minimizing the time and effort required.
- Flexibility: Users can create multiple groups for different scenarios, whether it's a household, a dinner outing, or a vacation trip.
- Transparency: Each group member can see the expenses added, who paid, and who needs to pay, fostering clear communication and accountability.
- Notifications and Reminders: Automated reminders help ensure that all group members are aware of pending payments, reducing the likelihood of missed payments.

In an era where shared living and group activities are prevalent, the need for an efficient expense management tool is clear. Our app aims to meet this need by simplifying the process of splitting bills and managing expenses, ultimately fostering better financial harmony and reducing conflicts within groups.
